            The mirror's image, it tells me it's home time<br />
            But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side<br />
            And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin', carryin' your shoes<br />
            Decided that once again I was just dreamin' of bumpin' into you</p><br />

            <p class="text3">Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind<br />
            Left you multiple missed calls and to my message, you reply<br />
            "Why'd you only call me when you're high?"<br />
            "Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"</p><br />

            <p class="text4">Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite<br />
            I need a partner, well, are you out tonight?<br />
            It's harder and harder to get you to listen<br />
            More I get through the gears<br />
            Incapable of makin' alright decisions, and havin' bad ideas</p><br />

            <p class="text3">Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind<br />
            Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply<br />
            "Why'd you only call me when you're high?"<br />
            "Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"</p><br />

            <p class="text4">And I can't see you here, wonderin' where am I<br />
            It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time<br />
            I haven't found all I was hopin' to find<br />
            You said you gotta be up in the mornin'<br />
            Gonna have an early night<br />
            And you're startin' to bore me, baby<br />
            Why'd you only call me when you're high?</p><br />

            <p class="text2">"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"<br />
            "Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"<br />
            "Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"<br />
